# Introdution to Interactive Programming in Python

This repo contains a list of games created as per the requirements of the coursera course "Introdution to Interactive Programming in Python"

The graphical user interfance is setup to run in [codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/). Running the games in a different python IDLE will require some code adjustments.
